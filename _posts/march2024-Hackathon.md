For this first hackathon, we build 4 cars equiped with Jetson, 1 RGBD camera, 2 fish-eye cameras and a Lidar. Due to the weight of these equipements, we had to strenght the shock
absorbers.

During the 6 intensive days of working for the students, they have:
1. Learned how to program the cars
2. Performed acquisitions of images and commands
3. Done the learning
4. Experiment on the circuit and ... refine their approach
